This Shopping List project displays the use of a search bar that connects to a seperate API that sends a list of food and beverages that may fit under the text provided in the search bar. The user can then add it to a list on the right hand side that displays the information of the product they added.
There is a also a folder feature that holds different lists the user may want and can rename for their convenience. The setting on the top right allows for the user to customize their experience for making the display larger or more comfortable by changing the properties of the site.

Reviewing the concepts I've learned proved to be very enjoyable and using Cursor helped elevate my understanding of concepts such as routing the client to the server, saving information, and even UI/UX. The Cursor AI helped me understand any problems that I was caught up in and further my understanding and process of web development.
